                       A/B Testing Project

Task
You've received an analytical task from an international online store. Your predecessor failed to complete it: they launched an A/B test and then quit (to start a watermelon farm in Brazil). They left only the technical specifications and the test results.


                           SQL Project
The coronavirus took the entire world by surprise, changing everyone's daily routine. City dwellers no longer spent their free time outside, going to cafes and malls; more people were home, reading books. That attracted the attention of startups that rushed to develop new apps for book lovers.
You've been given a database of one of the services competing in this market. It contains data on books, publishers, authors, and customer ratings and reviews of books. This information will be used to generate a value proposition for a new product.


                    Final Project description
virtual telephony service CallMeMaybe is developing a new function that will give supervisors information on the least effective operators. An operator is considered ineffective if they have a large number of missed incoming calls (internal and external) and a long waiting time for incoming calls. Moreover, if an operator is supposed to make outgoing calls, a small number of them is also a sign of ineffectiveness.
