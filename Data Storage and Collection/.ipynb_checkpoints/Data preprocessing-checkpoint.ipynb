Information on each customer such as number of children,number of children,number of days employed,ages of each customer,educational status,family status, gender,the income type, debt which explains whether a customer has ever defaulted a loan before or not, the total income per month and last but not least the purpose or reason for applying for the loan.\n",

    "    In addition to this,upon careful scrutiny of the data it was clear that some customers information such as the number of days employed and total income per month of 2174 customers were null or missing out 21525 customers.The missing or  NaN(null) entries means that without the number of days worked the total income of those customers affected cannot be determined. Also number days employed feature of customers had negative values which is not possible because it is impossible to have negative days worked. This can be  attributed to the floating point datatype when data was imported.\n",

The mean for each income level was used to replace each zero(0) value for each income level respectively.Out of this, months employed feature was created which can be use as an indicator for awarding loans to customers based on the years of experience or the number of years worked.\n",
